# landlord_program

Java version 15 or higher is a system requirement for running this program. 
Instructions on how to run this program are: 

(0) Having downloaded file Landlord.jar to your computer.
(1) Using Windows Command Prompt, change directory to the folder in which Landlord.jar is located. 
(2) Enter the following command to run the program: java -jar Landlord.jar

After running the program and selecting quit program from the user selection menu for the first time, 
three new .ser files will be generated in the folder containing the program. These files, (rent_list.ser, 
tenant_list.ser, expense_list.ser,) store the data recorded by the porgram. These files must be located in 
the same directory folder as the Landlord.jar program. Deleting these files will remove all records.
